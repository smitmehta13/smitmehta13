//                 <br/> <br/>
//                 We use <b>redis</b> as our database since it's really convenient and common practice to use it along Socket.IO due to scalability reasons and because redis provides data structures that are natural to work with <b>Socket.IO rooms</b>.

//                 With that in mind, and inspired on my lectures on the tree data structure I decided to create a web app that simulates the creation of such a tree given an expression. <br/><br/>
//                 <b>What I learned:</b> <br/>
//                 That stacks are REALLY useful. <br/>
//                 That drawing trees is actually harder than constructing them ðŸ¤£. The fact that the "twigs" might get tanggled up made my simulation problem a lot more complicated. <br/> <br/>
//                 I also learned several different algorithms including the <b>Knuth's algorithm</b> to help me do the layout of such trees and make sure they would not collide as I drew it. <br/>
//                 <b>Shunting-yard algorithm</b> was also used to parse an arithmethic expression efficiently from its <b>infix</b> form into its <b>postfix</b> form. <br/>
//                 From those, I managed to create my own algorithm (smit' algorithm ???) to convert the postfix expression into an actual tree data structure. <br/>
//                 I also finally learned about HTML5 canvas and how to make animations on it. <br/>
//                 Besides that, I finally used geometry in my life. I had to do some cool calculations with the edges of the nodes to make it look right.

//                 <b>How does it do that? </b> <br/>
//                 By the concept of a "meals" (aka what the user is about to eat). <br/>
//                 Users can add "meals" in three different ways: submitting a photo of the meal, recording an audio of what the meal is, or simple querying a meal with text. <br/><br/>
//                 Once a meal has been created, we collect the "glycemic load" and "glycemic index" (terms used in medical literature referring to a coefficient of how much such a meal would spike sugar levels on ones blood-stream) and adds it to the user's dashboard. <br/><br/>
//                 <b>What I did:</b> <br/>
//                 I played a key role on my team. I was responsible for the frontend application as a whole except for the UI which was done by a teammate. <br/>
//                 I programmed the camera and the audio recording system for meal creation purposes. Transformed the collected data into base64 and sent it to appropriate APIs (Clarifai Food Detection AI for image and Google Speech-To-Text for audio).
//                 With the decoded response from the APIs we could create a JSON with food details and portion sizes. <br/>
//                 With that information we could query Edaman API to get nutrition information about such meal and after that, with the nutrition info, my friend could dynamically scrape the glycemic index from a university website.
//                 After all this proccess we would add the computed results to the user's dashboard distinguishing if that meal would be good, medium or bad in terms of how it affects their sugar levels.
//                 <br/> <br/>
//                 <b>Difficulties:</b> <br/>
//                 Setting up the audio recording was the toughest thing for me, it was difficult because it was an asynchronous event and the documentation to perform that on react-native wasn't enough. <br/>
//                 And since we only had 24 hours, it was quite stressing.
//                 Another issue was the fact that Clarifai api only accepted an image via a URL. Therefore we needed to send the photo taken to AWS S3, upload it there, retrieve a URL of the image and then send it to Clarifai, which made our meal creation through image quite slow, which turned judges down :/<br/><br/>
//                 But other than that, everything was great and it was an amazing learning experience.

//                 <b>Challenges:</b><br/>
//                 The biggest challenge we faced was the transfer of audio data from server to the phone.

//                 Setting up the camera on our app was a little bit challenging too since it was my first time doing it on a React-Native app. However, expo-camera documentation made it easier than react-camera and this way we were able to set it up successfully on our app.

//                 Instead, we implemented a feature for users to request accounts, where they upload documents and useful information about their certification to the website, which sends a notification to us, the admins, about the user's request.

//                 Another tough feature to implement was the creation of an interactive calendar which was needed in order to store therapist's available hours. <br/>
//                 This was tough for a couple reason, we had to store multiple blocks of time in a way such that would enable back and frontend to efficiently retrieve the data, implement a user friendly way for users to select the available times and concatenate adjacent time blocks.

//                 <b>Planet Job</b> is a mobile app developed with the intent to help high schoolers find entry level job opportunities. <br/><br/>
//                 <b>What I developed?</b><br/>
//                 â€¢ Mobile application frontend which includes over 7 different screens and features such as user authentication, notification system, bookmarks and filtering.<br/>
//                 â€¢ Web crawler to collect job postings from websites such as <a class="link" href="https:/indeed.com">indeed</a> and using scikit learn, filtered the postings based on machine learning model which judged which were considered entry level jobs and which weren't.
//                 <br/><br/>
//                 <b>In order to?</b><br/>
//                 Create a user-friendly mobile app that is focused towards students. As high schoolers, we noticed wasting a lot of time filtering out the jobs that were actually entry level. Planet Jobs solves this issue by only collecting entry level jobs and volunteering positions. It allows the user to select tags related to what they would like to work with and notify them about new postings based on that and user's location.
